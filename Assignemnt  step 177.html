One thing i do enjoy abought my Dachsunds<br>is there cute and fluffy
ears that<br>not only look adorable but can be turned back to<br>give them
the ability to hear better.<br><br>They come in all sizes and colors. My<br> favorite
color combo is black with <span style="color:silver;font-weight:bold">silver</span>,<br>
red with some <span style="color:brown;font-weight:bold">brown</span>,<br>and
 <span style="color:tan;font-weight:bold">cream<span>!
